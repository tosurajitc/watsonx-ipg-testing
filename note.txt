You have local changes that are not yet pushed to GitHub, but you also want to pull your team memberâ€™s 
latest updates from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/tosurajitc/watsonx-ipg-testing) without losing your local work.


git status              #First, verify what changes are currently in your local environment:
git stash               #To avoid losing your local work, stash them safely
git pull origin main    #Now you can safely pull the latest updates:
git stash pop           #Once the pull is complete, reapply your local changes
                        # resolve conflicts if needed


To run : python manage.py runserver
